/**
 * **IMPORTANT**
 *
 * This object holds the permissions which will be synchronized into the `ax-id-service` on startup.
 *
 * The `key` of the permission is used to recognize individual permissions. If the `key` doesn't already exist in the service,
 * such a permission will be created. If the service contains a `key` that is not listed in this object, it will be removed from
 * the service (including all relations of it i.e. User Roles Assignments, Service Account Assignments)
 *
 * Renaming a permission `key` is potentially a destructive operation and special care must be taken if it really needs to be changed.
 *
 * It is recommended to leave the permission `key` unchanged and use the `title` property to reflect the required name change.
