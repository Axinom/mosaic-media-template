# Contribution Policy

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions
from everyone, whether you are an experienced programmer or a newcomer to open
source. To ensure a positive and productive experience for all contributors, we
have established the following guidelines:

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing to our project, please review our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to abide by
this code, which outlines our expectations for respectful behavior in our
community.

## How to Contribute

If you are interested in contributing to our project, we encourage you to review
our [documentation](https://portal.axinom.com/mosaic/documentation) and our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Axinom/mosaic-media-template/issues) to find
out what needs to be done. We also welcome contributions that improve our
documentation, test coverage, and other aspects of the project that aren't
strictly code-related.

Before making a change or adding a new feature to the project, we recommend that
you first raise an issue to discuss the change with the development team. This
can help ensure that the change aligns with the project's goals and objectives
and can avoid wasting time and effort on changes that might not be accepted.

Once you have identified a specific area where you'd like to contribute, please
follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes and make your changes on that branch.
3. Write tests for any new features or changes you make.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with your changes against the `dev` branch of the
   original repository.
5. Wait for a maintainer to review your changes and provide feedback.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When you submit a pull request, please follow these guidelines to help us review
your changes as quickly and efficiently as possible:

- Clearly describe the problem or feature you are addressing in your PR.
- Make sure your code follows our project's style and conventions.
- Provide tests for any new functionality you add or modify.
- Keep your changes focused on a single issue or feature.
- Include documentation and update any relevant documentation that may be
  impacted by your changes.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests will be reviewed by a project maintainer. We may suggest
changes or ask for additional tests to be added to ensure that the code is
high-quality and maintainable. We may also ask for additional documentation or
clarifications as needed. Please be patient while we review your PR, as it may
take some time to provide feedback and complete the review process.

## Conclusion

We appreciate all contributions to our project, big or small! Thank you for
helping to make our project better.
